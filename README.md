## Abstract

This browser extension hides the balloon animation that appears on top of the user profile avatar on Google domains.

## Tech Stack

This project uses vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

## Setup/Installation

You can clone the repo locally using `git clone`.

[This article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) offers detailed instructions on loading an unpacked chrome extension. You can navigate to the chrome extensions page via the puzzle piece icon in the toolbar. Enable "developer mode" on the top-right. From there, you can click "load unpacked extension" and choose the folder via the popup. You should then see the red balloon icon appear in the toolbar. When you click on it, you can see "No Google Birthdays." If you navigate to any page on the `google.com` domain you should not see the birthday balloons anymore.

Please post an issue if you're seeing the balloons elsewhere.
